# Abstract

In 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic changed the way we work. In April 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control released an early look at a study involving an outbreak in a South Korean call center. (1) The full results are due in August 2020, but it&#39;s quickly becoming clear that call centers were hit with a double blow: more calls are coming in, and fewer people are able to come into the office to take these calls.

Strict stay-at-home orders were issued in countries like the Philippines, where the average call center employee doesn&#39;t have access to the high-speed internet needed to take calls from home. Adding to the issues, companies like Charter Communications/Spectrum and Amazon came under fire for bringing employees into the office to work during the coronavirus crisis. (2)

This is leading many companies to seek help through the National Telecommuting Institute (NTI), a nonprofit that works with the Social Security Administration to recruit people with disabilities to work telecommuting jobs. The agency reports a 30% increase in companies seeking its staffing solutions in 2020 versus the same months in 2019. (3)

Moving from physical cubicles to virtual workstations is only feasible when using a cloud-based solution. Qubicles resolves the problems created by COVID-19 by creating a decentralized trust network of employees who can easily be transferred between projects as needed. It&#39;s a scalable solution that maximizes efficiency and flexibility to provide the optimal human resources to your call center.

Automation and virtual work was already on its way prior to the 2020 coronavirus epidemic. The lockdowns merely accentuated the issue, which is that many companies both large and small lack a seamless call center environment. That&#39;s where Qubicles comes in. Qubicles is a marketplace for job creation that connects call center agents with work. Its secondary function is to provide businesses seeking customer service, sales or support talent a single location to find such talent. Its tertiary function is to assist existing call centers in keeping staff busy by allowing them to join the network and find &#39;overflow&#39; work. For such call centers, the goal of Qubicles is to help them be &#39;right sized&#39; as much as possible, thereby lowering labor costs while optimizing their operations to increase customer satisfaction rates.

The global call center industry is a $400 billion dollar industry. There are approximately 65,000 call centers in North America and Canada and thousands of international call centers in India, Philippines, Pakistan, Caribbean and Latin America. In terms of the market size for customer service, sales and support reps (&quot;agents&quot;), there are roughly 3 million call center employees in the United States and millions of international workers in India, Philippines, and other countries across the globe. Due to the nature of the work, millions of unemployed workers in other disciplines can also join the network to train for and apply to customer service jobs.

For call center agents, Qubicles not only serves as a source of jobs; it serves as their means of indirectly entering the cryptocurrency market and joining what the creators of Qubicles believe is the next revolution in finance. With over 3 million call center agents in the United States alone and millions more worldwide (many of whom aren&#39;t familiar with or involved in cryptocurrency\*), Qubicles helps bring in the constituents of the call center industry into the cryptocurrency space through their daily work – providing a seamless and unobtrusive means of cryptocurrency investment for these individuals. Additionally, realizing that incentives play a major role in motivating call center agents to perform exceptionally, Qubicles will be combined with game theory and key performance indicators, such as average handle time and first call resolution, to automatically reward or penalize agents based on their performance. The intended outcome of this is to build agent reputation history on the blockchain to form a meritocracy that favors top performers.

Finally, one goal of Qubicles is to serve as a model for training and development via its Qubicles University, an elearning feature of the product that helps keep call center agents trained and informed on ever-changing company culture, processes, products, and services. By combining gamification with learning, Qubicles University aims to help call centers maintain a roster of highly qualified and trained staff.

Ultimately, we believe the efficiencies gained through automation and Blockchain adoption will allow Qubicles to become the largest and most effective provider of call center services across the globe.

# What Is Qubicles

Qubicles is a decentralized contact center networkthat connects businesses together. Through Qubicles, a business can take advantage of human resources leased to it from throughout the network in order to acquire the personnel necessary to handle customer interactions.

Some of the biggest challenges faced by contact centers include exorbitant operating and capital technology expenditures; a demanding labor force with costly recruiting, training and recognition programs, yet unusually high attrition; lackluster customer experiences and low satisfaction, as measured by customer satisfaction (CSAT), customer dissatisfaction (DSAT), and net promoter scores (NPS); as well as service level challenges measured via three key industry performance indicators: first call resolution (FCR), average speed of answer (ASA), and average handle time (AHT).

The award-winning team behind Qubicles has spent the last 15 years in the contact center industry working on solving some of the industry&#39;s technical challenges and ever-increasing costs, with a high degree of success. With Qubicles, they are embarking on a journey to address the labor issues of the industry by creating a decentralized platform for training, resource sharing, automatic payment distribution, and rewards-based incentives.

The Qubicles network solves two significant labor force problems affecting contact centers today. The first problem is the issue of excess capacity (payrolled, non-billable time) in the form of agent idle time. Contact centers often pay hourly for representatives who are simply idle while waiting to handle customer interactions. According to [Aberdeen](http://www.aberdeen.com/pal/8092/30410096/link.aspx?ccode=blog), agents spend approximately 25% of their time in an idle state. In a standard 8-hour shift, this results in a loss of 2 hours per work day or 10 hours per 5-day work week simply due to idle time. With an agent pay rate of $10.50 per hour, at a 100-agent contact center, this results in approximately $546,000 lost to idle time per year. As can be seen, this amounts to serious losses that could be better spent creating more value.

The second problem solved by the Qubicles network is the problem of insufficient staffing for peak seasons. During peak seasons, the volume of interactions spikes and it becomes a hassle for a contact center to procure the necessary staff to handle the increased volume effectively. According to [emarketer.com](https://www.emarketer.com/Report/US-Holiday-Shopping-Preview-2017-Recapping-2016-Looking-Ahead-This-Season/2001992), US retail ecommerce sales increased by 17.8% during the 2016 holiday shopping season. An increase in sales typically means an increase in call volumes at contact centers as customers reach support for various purchase-related issues. This leaves contact centers with the challenge of efficient hiring and scheduling for a busy season, while attempting to minimize their customer abandonment rate. Disasters such as hurricanes or the recent COVID-19 epidemic are examples of scenarios where unexpected demand may surface.

Below, we describe how Qubicles solves these problems.

## Idle Time Resource Pool

At a contact center, oftentimes a representative is idle while he or she is waiting to handle customer interactions, typically due to lower-than-expected call volumes rather than a fault of their own. The employer pays for this lapse in productivity, especially if the representative is paid by the hour. With Qubicles, an employer can auction its employees&#39; idle time to other businesses and individuals on the network in need of additional human resources to complete tasks. An employer leasing out its own surplus human resources to other businesses is paid for doing so, thus keeping its workforce productive while generating additional value even during moments of idleness. This system creates a pool of available representatives and a marketplace for their idle time for use by businesses in need of additional staffing.

## Elastic Staffing

During a business&#39;s peak seasons, contact centers are faced with the task and challenges of building an efficiently-sized staff necessary to handle the increase in interaction volume. A contact center typically begins a lengthy process to acquire the necessary staff. First, the contact center must analyze past years and predict the number of representatives needed during the peak season. For sophisticated contact center operations, this process is typically performed using advanced workforce management software while less sophisticated centers rely on manual entries from old Excel spreadsheets. Then, the contact center recruits staff utilizing either its own human resources department, or a recruiting/staffing agency. Should the contact center decide to hire a recruiting agency to meet its staffing needs, it would need to provide supporting information including the total number of representatives required, language proficiency requirements, skillsets, experience requirements, background check requirements, a budget per representative, and a desired schedule. After a cumbersome negotiation period, the staffing agency then sends potential recruits to the contact center, which then vets and trains the potential recruits according to its own practices.

It is the Qubicles network&#39;s pool of human resources which solves the problem of short-staffing during peak seasons. Contact centers are able to access the network of representatives whose idle times have been marked as available, and make a request for personnel which includes all the requirements for the position. Payment, vetting, and training are all performed automatically by different aspects of the system, requiring the contact center manager only to listen to the provided voice samples of potential recruits and to select which recruits shall be hired. This cuts out the recruiting agency middle-man completely, saving the contact center time and money.

The Qubicles network creates a decentralized market of talent and a shared pool of human resources allowing for greater productivity and an increase in value produced by businesses.

## Workforce Stats API

Proper workforce management is critical to the efficient planning, allocating, and utilizing of human resources within most critical contact center operations. Intra-day planning and forecasting for staffing purposes requires key metrics from contact center software platforms. These include call volumes by interval (by half hour, by hour, etc), busy hour statistics, average call times, average speed of answer, and more. When analyzed, these metrics assist workforce management analysts in determining the staffing requirements needed to achieve their contact center&#39;s customer service goals and overall business objectives.

As the creators of Qubicles are the developers of the award-winning Qubicles for Contact Centers (QCC) cloud-based software, formerly known as Fenero, key performance indicators on interaction traffic and usage patterns for agents are automatically integrated into the service. This aides in providing automated volume forecasts and suggestions on right-sized resource requirements to help contact centers deliver exceptional customer service.

# Components of Qubicles

## Contact Center Infrastructure

The underlying contact center infrastructure for Qubicles consists of proven contact center technology formerly known as Fenero. Called Qubicles for Contact Centers, or QCC, it provides all of the features needed to run small to large sized contact center operations. QCC is a live product being used by hundreds of companies across the globe, and consists of:

- Provisioning of toll-free or local phone numbers for over 30 countries
- Advanced inbound and outbound call routing [including automated call distribution (ACD), interactive voice response (IVR), and manual, progressive and predictive dialing]
- Robust campaign and lead management functionality
- Quality assurance with call recordings, audits and scoring
- Detailed reports, analytics and API-integration capabilities
- Drag-and-drop call center scripting designer
- Basic email support and live customer chat
- Customer relationship management for sales, marketing and service
- 100% cloud-based with built-in WebRTC browser-based phone
- Unlimited use: no cap on users, queues, campaigns, lists, etc
- Pay per use: prepaid usage on account

These core capabilities form the foundation upon which the novelty of the Qubicles network ecosystem is built.

## Telos Blockchain

The Qubicles network is built on the Telos blockchain. The technical superiority of Telos, combined with its high number of transactions per second (TPS) and strong developer community makes this blockchain the perfect foundational component of Qubicles.

The reasons for using a blockchain to power Qubicles are many. On a decentralized system, there is less likely to be a single point of failure on the network unlike that of a centralized one, whereby if a core node in the network fails, the entire system is affected. However, in Telos and other decentralized protocols, the network&#39;s data and resources is distributed among many nodes and requires a larger number of nodes to fail before the network is adversely impacted. Additionally, being built on a blockchain will allow creative uses of incentivization and trust, as transactions can be independently verified and eliminates the need for blind centralized trust.

##

## Qubicle Token

An important function of the Qubicles system is its underlying token, called a _Qubicle (QBE)_, used to facilitate access to resources within the network. It is also used to reward or penalize customer service agents for being top performers, further incentivizing them to deliver high quality experiences to their customers.

A token such as Qubicle provides a mechanism for financial incentive to drive the Qubicles network and also provide Qubicles with secure, easily-validated transactions without the need for third-party validation.

Members of the network use QBE tokens as the sole medium of exchange for activities and transactions. They are also rewarded with QBE tokens for being top performers according to network statistics via a QBE-generating reward points system. Furthermore, each member of the network possesses a Telos wallet to store their QBE balance. As users will undoubtedly require fiat for daily living, this wallet will support a mechanism for fiat withdrawals (EUR, USD, etc) in addition to allowing users to store QBE in-wallet for speculation or similar purposes.

Ownership of QBE tokens grant holders the right to the Qubicles network&#39;s transaction protocol solely for the purposes of accumulating rewards and utilizing the platform. It does not represent or confer any ownership stake, share or security rights, intellectual property rights or any other form of participation relating to Qubicles capitalization.

The business model behind Qubicles is as follows:

- Employers pay 0.05% of employee hourly wages as a &#39;job completion fee&#39;
- Agents pay 0.05% of hourly compensation received as a &#39;job finders fee&#39;
- Fees are collected when Employer funds from escrow are released to Agents (weekly)

Additional factors of the model include the following terms:

- Employers are required to deposit USD in escrow for wages
- Employers and agents must purchase QBE tokens to post/apply to jobs or create/attend courses. Tokens can also be earned via performance and referral rewards
- A minimum of $20 USD per user/month must be consumed to remain active in network

A core aspect of the Qubicles business model is requiring users to maintain a positive balance of QBE on their account prior to using the network. Upon launch, several airdrop marketing campaigns will be executed to assist with our initial user growth - however, the core model requires users to purchase Qubicles using fiat in order to load their accounts and use the service. This method will further extend the reach of blockchain technology to millions in a demographic that isn&#39;t highly proficient in cryptocurrency speculation and investment.

## Qubicles Escrow

Qubicles provides a mechanism for mediating payment and work disputes for its users. The service supports a multi-signature escrow system that will allow an Employer and Agent to enter into an agreement with a neutral third-party arbitrator. Under this multi-signature system, an amount to be paid is held in escrow and requires two signatures in order for the final transfer of funds to occur. If the Employer and Agent agree on the funds to be transferred, they both sign the transaction and the funds are moved out of escrow to the party being paid. Should there be a dispute regarding the payment between the Employer and the Agent, the neutral arbitrator steps in and makes the decision whether or not to provide his or her signature as the second signature necessary for the transaction to occur. This system allows for automated mediation of disputes without the need of a centralized regulatory body.

## Members of the Network

There are three principal actors on the Qubicles network. We refer to the first of these actors as the _Employer_. The Employer has a need for human resources and places a request on the Qubicles network for a task or a role it would like to see fulfilled, along with a set of qualifications for that job or role.

The second actor on the network consists of _Agents_, workers who either make up businesses such as call and contact center business process outsourcers (BPO) or individuals, including independent contractors (1099) or sole proprietors specializing in providing customer service, sales, or support. Whether they are BPO or 1099 Agents, they bring value to the Qubicles network by providing the human resources talent necessary to make the ecosystem operate. Qubicles automatically tracks real time worker utilization data - such as time spent on a call, billable unproductive time, and after call work time - from the QCC platform (and eventually from competitors supporting the Qubicles Workforce Stats API). They respond to requests created by Employers and pay for job application submissions using QBE tokens. Each worker possesses qualifications and Employers seek certain qualifications for particular roles. Workers can acquire qualifications and certifications of skills through Qubicles University. Additionally, each actor will be assigned a unique Qubicles ID that will be used to verify their activity on the network.

Employers and Agents interact through _smart contracts_, scripts which are created by an Employer and accepted by an Agent. A smart contract is a protocol used to enforce the provisions of a contract utilizing some degree of automation. Many aspects of traditional contracts can be automated by smart contracts. For example, using a smart contract, it is possible for a system to check whether or not a required task has been performed in accordance with the agreed-upon provisions in the smart contract, and automatically send payments to the necessary parties. In Qubicles, Employers create smart contracts to act as automated employment agreements between themselves and the Agents they hire. Upon fulfilling the terms of the agreement, an Agent is automatically paid using Employer funds from escrow in accordance with the rules of the smart contract. Employers will also award points to Agents based on their overall performance, which will translate into QBE rewards for higher performing agents.

The third actor in Qubicles are independent or corporate trainers. Trainers are responsible for producing high quality content for courses in Qubicles University.

## Qubicles University

Employers want to make sure that the Agents they are leasing for a job are up to their standard of quality and are trained for the particular campaigns they are assigned to. Qubicles University is a method of ensuring that the pool of human resources on the network possess verifiable core skills expected of contact center personnel (such as customer service, outbound sales, etc) but also program-specific requirements delivered with a high degree of quality.

Various courses, created by members of the Qubicles network, are available in Qubicles University on a myriad of essential skills. Examples can include free or paid user-generated courses in customer service, knowledge of specific campaigns or products, and language proficiency. A worker may take a course, which will cost the worker QBE tokens to be paid to the creator of the course, and receive certification in that course&#39;s skill upon passing it. All work certifications will be tied to their unique Qubicles ID and made publicly available and verifiable via the Telos blockchain.

Furthermore, when an Employer chooses to post a request on the network, among its desired qualifications for the request, the Employer may select certain courses from Qubicles University it wishes all workers applying for the role to have passed. The creator of the course will receive QBE tokens for each instance this occurs. Thus, trainers are provided with a financial incentive to create quality course content for Qubicles University.

It follows that course creators are competing in an open marketplace. As an example, a Spanish professor at a college or a university who has a desire to earn some extra money can simply create a Spanish Language course on Qubicles University after paying a fee in QBE tokens. However, if the professor wants his or her course to be successful on the platform, he or she must ensure that the created Spanish Language course is of high enough quality to be able to compete with already existing Spanish Language courses on the platform. If it is a good enough course, it will ostensibly be chosen by more Employers and taken by more Agents, and the creator will be paid for each instance of its use.

Through a competitive e-learning marketplace, the creation of high-quality learning materials is incentivized, continuously improving, in turn, the quality of the human-resource pool on the network.

## Qubicle Ratings Engine

To help increase the quality of work performed in Qubicles, members will be given numerous opportunities to earn QBE via our Qubicle Ratings Engine. Upon job completion, Employers must rate Agents based on their job performance to help the Qubicle Ratings Engine determine an appropriate distribution percentage for QBE rewards or performance penalties. Additional metrics such as average handle time, quality assurance scores, conversion percentages and more will be used to determine agent reward eligibility. Agents will also rate their experience working with Employers and attending courses from specific trainers, which will result in the Qubicle Ratings Engine determining a rewards assignment for the employer or course publisher.

## Sample Scenarios

### Contact Center Use Case

In order to illustrate the essential features of the Qubicles network, we will walk through an example scenario.

It is the holiday season and call volume is high at the Holiday Decorations Company (HDC) contact center. The contact center manager is realizing that she is going to need more personnel in order to provide the high-quality customer service HDC is known for. In light of this realization, the manager decides to place a request for personnel on the Qubicles network.

The manager begins the request by describing the kind of work she needs to be done: &quot;provide friendly and helpful customer service relating to a variety of holiday decoration items&quot;. Then, the manager starts going through the skills she needs an applicant to possess. She types the words &quot;Customer Service Experience&quot; and then she selects a course from Qubicles University on customer service that she knows produces friendly workers. Anyone who applies to this position will have to take and pass the courses the manager has selected, if they haven&#39;t already done so. After selecting the customer service course, the manager repeats this process by specifying the additional skills she needs: &quot;knowledge of decorative goods&quot;, and &quot;bilingual in English and Spanish&quot; (she selects the appropriate Bilingual Spanish course in Qubicles University and optionally pays QBE tokens on behalf of job applicants to the course&#39;s creator). A course on Decorative Goods did not exist in the Qubicles University, so she uses the network&#39;s eLearning module to create her own Decorative Goods course, along with its associated lesson plans, quizzes, and assessment tests (and pays QBE to the network to publish this custom course for use by other users in the ecosystem).

After selecting the skills or creating her own campaign-specific courses, the manager starts preparing the smart contract that will specify the terms of employment. She needs someone to be available on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8 AM to 1 PM until February 1. She is willing to pay $10.50 USD an hour and deposits the first week&#39;s USD payment to escrow. Lastly, she needs the worker to handle chat support, as well as both inbound and outbound calls.

### Call Center Entrepreneur Use Case

Bob is an aspiring call center entrepreneur who lives in a city far away from any Holiday Decorations Company call center. He is ready to start his career in the customer service industry and selects two friends, Alice and John, to join him in forming ABC Contact Center, Inc.

For each representative (including himself), Bob fills out a _Resource Definition_. Each Resource Definition includes a unique identifier, a list of skills and certifications of courses passed on Qubicles University, availability and schedule, price per unit (per minute, per hour, etc), and the type of customer service that representative is experienced in (chat, email, inbound/outbound calls, and such).

Alice&#39;s Resource Definition shows that she has customer service skills (in fact, she has taken the course specified by the HDC call center manager), that she is available on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 8 AM to 1 PM, that she is willing to work for at least $10.25 USD per hour, and that she is experienced in chat, email, inbound/outbound calls, and SMS.

Because Alice matches up very well with the HDC manager&#39;s request for personnel, the Qubicles network recommends that request to her. The only qualification Alice is missing in order to take the request is Spanish language proficiency, so she pays for and passes the required Spanish language course. After passing the Spanish language course, Alice records a voice sample and applies for the position. An automated background check from a third-party provider is also performed and the result stored on chain. There is no issue found and Alice is ready to work.

Back at the HDC contact center, the manager receives Alice&#39;s application. She listens to the voice sample and finds it satisfactory and decides to hire Alice, along with many other good applicants automatically suggested by the Qubicles network.

Alice does her job well for the required period of time, and is automatically paid according to the terms of the smart contract. She is given a top rating by the HDC manager and earns QBE rewards bonus for her awesome performance. Bob is happy to see revenue coming into his brand-new contact center and HDC is now able to provide a much higher quality of service.

###

### Independent Agent Use Case

John is a retired military veteran who was awarded a Purple Heart for an injury on the battlefield that cost him both legs. Despite his disability, he works with the Wounded Warrior Project and does what he can to contribute to the country he gave everything to protect and serve. Commuting, moving around a large office building, and the other hassles of keeping regular employment aren&#39;t easy and John prefers to work in the comfort of his own home.

Still, John has a friendly demeanor and loves working on his computer. A call center job where he can set his own hours and work on the phone reading scripts gives him daily human connection and helps him feel like he&#39;s still accomplishing something in his life. The ability to put a smile on people&#39;s faces is all he really needs, and he has the refined discipline only a soldier has.

Because Qubicles is cloud-based, John spends some time taking courses at Qubicles University. Between his past military experience and his demonstrated knowledge, he&#39;s easily able to build a reputation as a freelance call center agent. His on-network reputation is raised with each successful project, so hiring managers know they can depend on him to provide world class service as needed on their projects.

Using Qubicles, John can easily take on as many or as few projects as he wants. He can work full-time or part-time, and his rating sticks with him throughout his career so none of his time feels wasted. The ability to generate revenue and provide for his family is all John ever wanted, and he&#39;s an invaluable asset to the companies he works with.

###

### Stablecoin Payment Benefits

Building an efficient call center isn&#39;t easy. It involves pulling agents from around the world to connect virtually. (4) Managing call volumes across these large geographic areas is hard enough, but even paying these employees creates issues with the speed of international currency transfers.

The HR and payroll departments of a company with operations spreading across countries like the U.S., India, and the Philippines often deal with discrepancies caused by payment timing issues. A worker&#39;s shift can stretch across two calendar days working &quot;9 to 5&quot; serving customers on the other side of the world. In addition, payment may be initiated on Friday, which won&#39;t be processed until Monday, potentially causing massive differences in currency exchange rates.

Ultimately, another goal of Qubicles is to adopt a cryptocurrency stablecoin such as USDT to make it much easier for employees around the world to be paid evenly and fairly for doing the same job. The exchange rates between QBE and Telos, BTC, or local currencies like the U.S. Dollar or Indian Rupee are much cheaper and easier to manage than typical payroll. The decentralized digital ledger also makes tracking payroll much easier and more transparent.

Bank transfer fees, foreign exchange rates, and other fees are removed from the process, ensuring a smooth payroll process with fewer discrepancies and less time wasted fielding exceptions.

# Qubicles Team

The team behind Qubicles has a combined 50 years of experience in the contact center industry and are the leaders behind Fenero, a disruptive and award-winning cloud based contact center platform used by over 2,200 call and customer service organizations worldwide.

## Birth of Qubicles and Contact Center Innovation

Fenero was born out of necessity, when our founder led the information technology department for a prominent business process outsourcer based in Miami, FL. This outsourcer handles blended sales, customer service, and support campaigns on behalf of its Fortune 500 customers. Since inception, this organization used a beta version of CellIT Technologies&#39; CCPRO product and was a common site for visits showcasing CellIT&#39;s new product. After successfully growing CCPRO, CellIT Technologies was purchased by Concerto Software and later merged with Aspect Communications to form Aspect Software. CCPRO was rebranded EnsemblePro and provided an on-premise deployment of inbound, outbound, and IVR software for this outsourcer.

After purchasing the assets of another outsourcer, which used Avaya as their contact center platform, our founder and his team spearheaded a company-wide initiative to replace the EnsemblePro product with the acquired Avaya solution. With major plans for growth, license restrictions for the Avaya system and a very costly upgrade path to Avaya&#39;s latest solutions, our founder was tasked yet again with finding the next technology platform for this organization. Oracle&#39;s Contact Center Anywhere, Interactive Intelligence, InContact, and several other incumbent vendor solutions were evaluated, but all required either a significant up-front capital expenditure or a costly per-seat license – or they simply did not meet the organization&#39;s requirements.

Identifying this as a major opportunity to make an impact on the industry, and with some prior experience using the Asterisk open source telephony framework, our founder set out to build a 100% cloud-based and licensing-free solution geared towards managing customer interactions for contact centers of all sizes. Henceforth, what was to eventually become Qubicles was born.
