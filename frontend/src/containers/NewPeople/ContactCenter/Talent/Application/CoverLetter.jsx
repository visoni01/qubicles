        As someone who's made over 100,000 sales calls and sold tend of millions of dollars
        of services and products, I clearly understand how challenging it can be to gain appointments, demos, and sales.
        You can see by my ratings and reviews that i'm very effective at what I do. I can tell you, however, that many
        business owners I speak with about using a telesales component for their sales and marketing have not developed
        the other needed areas to lay the proper groundwork for as succesful telesales campaign.

        Successful sales and marketing is only possile through the correct choices. Do you understand how to make the
        best choices in each area when it comes to your sales and marketing... or are you guessing ? How crucial is it
        to you (and your income) to actually solve the problem ? Have you experience enough "pain" through delays and
        lack of results?
